We're happy to announce a new kernel competition focused on classical linear algebra problems. These problems are old, important but still underexplored on modern hardware like B200.

We've been quiet in the last few months because it's quite hard to start a new neolab but we wanted to give you a sense as to the kinds of things we're working on. Most recently we've been dusting off our old linear algebra textbooks such as Trefethen and Bau since a lot of the workloads we're trying to accelerate break down to classical linear algebra problems with the first one being QR decomposition.

At a high level the goal is to take a real square matrix A and decompose it into A = QR where Q is an orthogonal matrix Q^{T} = Q^{-1} and R is an upper triangular matrix. The Gram-Schmidt process goes back to the 1800s. Gram's work was in 1883, Schmidt's more explicit version came in 1907.

The QR problem shows up everywhere but one recent application of interest is second-order optimization methods because those need to keep learned curvature directions orthogonal and numerically stable over time.

A modern approach is Householder QR. For each column, find a mirror that flips the column's below-diagonal entries to zero in one shot, leaving a single value on the diagonal. Reflect the whole remaining matrix through that mirror, move to the next column, and repeat. Because each column's reflection depends on the result of the previous one, the naive algorithm is inherently sequential and GPU unfriendly.

But in the famous words of our colleague Sonic, if we can parallelize prefix sums we can parallelize anything and there are indeed GPU-friendly algorithms such as blocked Householder where the trick is to accumulate reflections into a compact form and then apply one big matmul.

So for the first QR problem the reference implementation will be torch.geqrf which stands for GEneral QR Factorization. The reference implementation returns compact Householder factors (H, tau), the evaluator materializes Q and extracts R = triu(H) and checks the following properties

Factorization: R ~= Q.T @ A
Orthogonality: Q.T @ Q ~= I
Reconstruction: Q @ R ~= A
Triangularity: lower(Q.T @ A) ~= 0.
However, we chose to define relative tolerances and scale them by n * eps32. The reason for this is we want you to experiment with approaches that lose accuracy by using lower bit widths but then try to recover it back. The benchmarks will mostly test dense random square matrices but the tests include rank-deficient, near-rank-deficient, banded, row-scaled, near-collinear, upper-triangular, and clustered-scale inputs because random dense matrices are not enough.
